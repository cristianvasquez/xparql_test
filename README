A little playground console for:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xsparql/

Added here since I cannot branch it from sourceforge

1) Prerequisites
You will need at least:
  * Java JDK (at least Java 5): http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/
  * Apache Maven 2: http://maven.apache.org/

The central Apache Maven repository contains almost all dependencies of XSPARQL. Because of licensing issues the following dependencies have to be downloaded manually and installed to your local maven repository:

* The Saxon XSLT and XQuery Processor from Saxonica Limited, download from http://www.saxonica.com/
    if you have a license for Saxon EE you can use saxon9-ee.jar
    otherwise the home edition (HE) is enough (saxon9.jar)

* Install the jar file in your local maven repository:
    mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=net.sf.saxon -DartifactId=saxon -Dversion=9.3 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<path-to-jar-file>

* Building XSPARQL
   mvn install

* Running the console as a webapp
   mvn tomcat:run
